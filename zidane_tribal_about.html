		<h1><strong>About</strong></h1>
		<p class="intro"> Virtue - You don't need a reason to help people.<br/>
—Zidane's quote<br/>

<br/>Zidane Tribal[ziˈdɑːn] is the main protagonist of Final Fantasy IX. He is a thief who works for the Tantalus Theater Troupe set to kidnap the princess of Alexandria, an event that escalates to a quest to protect the planet of Gaia.

Zidane possesses little of the sullenness associated with previous Final Fantasy protagonists, Cloud Strife and Squall Leonhart; he enjoys making new friends and is always on the lookout to help those in need.</p>
